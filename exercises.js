/*Hey Prepstars!!!  By now, you should have a good understanding of the basics of Javascript. 

The following exercises will be a good review of the materials we covered in class. Run node in your terminal to test your code.

Don't forget to commit and push your work after each completed exercise.

Now, unleash your coding beast!
